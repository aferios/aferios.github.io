I am a student of mathematics who attended the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC).
There, I worked with professors of mathematics under the Illinois Geometry Lab--a gateway for undergraduates of math to conduct research.
For part of 2018, I worked with [Professor Sowers](http://publish.illinois.edu/r-sowers/) and [Professor Hernandez](https://beckman.illinois.edu/directory/person/mhernand). With them, our team developed a platform for detecting and analyzing anxiety and movement disorders.
For the rest of 2018 and going on to 2019, I worked with [Professor Hirani](https://faculty.math.illinois.edu/~hirani/) and [Professor Krishnan](https://arch.illinois.edu/faculty/sudarshan-krishnan-phd). Our research centered around finding exotic geometries that were favored in architecture for their lightness in weight, cost effective, high capacity to withstand great force, and unique design.
My studies do not remain closed in mathematics. During my time at University, I delved into research with [Professor Cheng](http://joeytcheng.com/lab/members). With her, I helped analyze how power heirarchies worked and what it is that drives people to success, with the definition of success varying depending on the environment.

As for the things I like to do outside academics, I enjoy participating in Muay Thai and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu sessions, going to arcades and playing rhythm games or Tekken 7, and simply enjoying fountain pens.
The arcade games I mainly play, in order of preference, are Pump It Up Prime series, DDRA20, SoundVoltex VividWave, and ITG. 
As an aside, if anyone is looking to get into any of these games and feels the cabinet is being hogged, please do not hesitate to ask the player if you can go next when the song is over. Do not be afraid of looking bad, just have fun with it. We were all there before.
I currently write with a Platinum 1377, UEF nib.
As for pencils, I write with a Pentel Graphgear 1000 0.3HB lead. 
Unfortunately for me, 0.2 variants are extremely difficult to find in the US.
