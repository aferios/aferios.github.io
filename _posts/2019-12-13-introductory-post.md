As the title suggests, this is an introductory post about the author of this website.
Born and raised in Chicago. Went through my primary and secondary education going through Chicago Public Schools (CPS).
Afterwards, I continued education at the University of Illinois and Wilbur Wright College
(more commonly CCC or City Colleges of Chicago).
Under each school, I pursued sciences and technology until I stumbled upon the only hard science academia had to offer: mathematics.
Like most undergraduates, I didn't want to be unemployable post-graduation so I decided to concentrate in Applied Mathematics. Research took me down this route of applying whatever it is I learned in my classes and classes were simply a way for me to pursue--what I thought to be--the more fun and pure mathematics.
The two best classes I took thus far are Linear Algebra for those majoring in mathematics and Complex Variables. The former for me being a complete sucker for the magic that can be done in linear transformations, and the latter for my professor's mannerisms and speech in presenting the material in a digestible manner.
For the research groups I have been in, I loved playing a part in Virtual Cliffs, Virtual Reality (VCVR).
The objective being to develop a platform for analysis of anxiety and movement disorders. We had a lot of fun developing a few of the concepts that would be used in the VR world and how to make the data coming in from a separate useful for the virtual world's purposes.

As for the other research groups I have participated in, our Search For Tensgrities effort was fairly fun and as it turned out had more applications than we initially realized. I had established a semi-working webapp built to make dome-like tensegrities. In addition to that, we were able to implement an algorithm with a few of our own adjustments that was able to conjure tensegrities given a set of 3D points. Our work in the first half was largely dedicated to learning about the topic and then we were able to implement any ideas we had using the foundation already established.
I have also done some for a
