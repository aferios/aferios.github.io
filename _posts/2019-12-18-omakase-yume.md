For a while now, I have 
been actively learning Japanese--albeit, in a very sloppy manner--from various resources provided on the 
internet. Given I know a very primitive grammar structure and a handful of baby verbal vocabulary,
I figured it wouldn't be bad if I just expanded my verbal vocabulary, learned the writing system on the side,
and learned some kanji as well while memorizing the characters of hiragana and katakana. Needless to say, I am
scatterbrained when it comes to learning this language but it's not like I am getting a grade so if it works, it works I guess.

On December 6th of this year, I was walking around and came across a restaurant in the West Loop neighborhood
of Chicago. The title, or name, given was Omakase Yume. Dissecting the title yielded two words, one unfamiliar and
an familiar, omakase and yume respectively. 

Diving into my memories, I recall a game I used to play and a manga a friend had told me about: Yume Nikki and Mirai Nikki.
Mirai Nikki I associated with Future Diary, its English name. From here its easy to yield the meaning for *yume*.

But what about *omakase*? Before resorting to the internet, I decided to take a page from a proof in an undergrad CS
book a roommate of mine encountered. *Think*. Well, there's two possibilities. It may be the case that *omakase*
is a noun or some sort of verb. The titles I had encountered in my past had a noun, *nikki*, trailing behind the dream,
and not to mention *omakase* ends in something that looks verb-like. It seems more likely to be a verb than noun.
So what could *omakase* mean? Given that it's a restaurant, it may have something to do with food.
I doubt it means "to cook", as I've heard it in videos pronounced as "kuku". I doubt it means to boil or simmer,
as I've heard it in other videos pronounced much differently. Come to think of it, I haven't heard this word at all.

From here I give up and search up the word *omakaseru*. According to wikipedia, it is a phrase meaning
"I'll leave it up to you". It is commonly used in restaurants so signify that the chef is the one serving the dish.
That is a very nice title. Altogether, *Omakase Yume* means "leave it to the chef to serve you the dream dish".
Not quite a good ring in English but the meaning is packaged very nicely.
