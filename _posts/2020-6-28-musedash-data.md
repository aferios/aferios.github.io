title: Muse Dash and Potential for a Project

I got back into rhythm games not so long ago from the date of this post.
I used to play Dance Dance Revolution (DDR) on the PlayStation and Gamecube (yes, the Mario Mix, which was banging), 
Tap Tap Revenge when that was a thing,
and of course Guitar Hero and Rock Band when they were rolling around.
One I got into last year was Muse Dash. 
At first, I thought it was a crappy game that was basically trying to cash in on the mobile rhythm-game train
with [Cytus][1], [Voez][2], [Lanota][3], and Arcaea, but the quarantine got me back into it.
I bought it on mobile when introduced to it, then on PC a bit ago. 
So far, I've got top 1000 scores on a few of the vanilla charts. Please don't snipe me.
I recently bought the Just As Planned pack for PC because it was on sale.
I'm really loving it.

# My Time With Muse Dash
Any time I played a chart, I record my session, which is absolutely expensive.
It's costing me so much memory to actually keep the damn videos.
I've used it just to find where I mess up and what I really need to work on.
It's a dextrous activity, so improving is just a matter of practice and training muscle memory.
The videos also help me iron out my rhythm.
When playing, it's sometimes difficult to catch why the game thought your input was a Great instead of a Perfect,
especially when you're focused on just hitting the keys. 
The feedback/slap-back sounds are supposed to help with that, but they don't always cut it for me.

# Lueur de la Nuit
So [Lueur de la Nuit][4] was a song I was able to grind out during a break from my studies.
Each song has three different difficulties which we call charts.
I was playing an 8, so the lingo would be that I was playing the 8 chart, and it is an extremely fun chart. 
The song sounds like something that should be in a Japanese role-playing game in the setting of a carnival.
For some reason, the song reminds me of the pinball machines in [Sonic Adventure Battle][5].

Anyways, [I made a video][6] shwocasing one of the better of my final plays.
It's also an "analysis" video. 
I show where I went wrong, how I fixed it, and it's easy to see where improvement is needed in the final showcase.

Yes, I did fail to finish the song. 
I'm willing to bet the last bit of the chart isn't even anything I have to hit.
The character, or muse as the game likes to call them, is [Devil Marija][7].
At the cost of her health decreasing over time (10 hit points, or HP, per second), 
she will give you 25% more points when knocking back anything.
The elfin that is required to use with her is called [Little Devil Lilith][8],
she is the little companion on the top left corner of the video. 
She just gives you 5% more scores for all Perfects hit,
and restores 2 HP for each Perfect hit (music notes also count as Perfects).
The HP restoration is only excluside to Devil Marija.
This is why I was unable to reach the end of the chart.
Remedying this is simple. All I have to do is get good, get more Perfects than Greats, and don't get hit.
I just need to Perfect Full Combo (PFC) this chart, and I'm golden.

# Ji-Ja-Bytes of Data
Muse Dash is very unhelpful in getting you to improve. 
Except for the little loading screen tip that tells you to keep trying if you don't succeed.
I will put how unhelpful it is in context.
Games like the Pump It Up (PIU) series, DDR, and SoundVoltex let you see your statistics regardless of a win or loss.
A case can be made against PIU, 
but I would argue cabinet owners (people who have the arcade setup)
are more to blame because they are able to toggle fails off; however, that's not what we're here for.
Games like In The Groove (ITG), Stepmania5, and even osu! take it a step further by showing very detailed stats.
It will show you how off you were from a Perfect each time you hit a Perfect.
It will say something like "15ms off from a Perfect half the time, while the other half you were 12ms off".
It can present to you a graph of how you did. These graphs are comparable to cumulative distribution functions.
These show how well your score is doing against against someone else.
Histograms on score ranges, cumulative score graphs, Great- vs Great+, 
these games go a step further in showing you where you can improve.
Muse Dash just gives you your score at the end of the game only if you manage to beat the chart.
All the stats tell you is your max combo, number of Perfects, number of Greats, number of Passes,
number of Lates (not number of Late Perfects or Late Greats, just Lates),
and number of Earlies.

The reason I made this post was because I want to discuss future possibilites.
As mentioned earlier, I record all my sessions whenever I play a chart.
I have maybe 100 GB (its pretty close that actually) of footage of me just mashing on my keyboard.
Some are failures; some are passes, 
and some look the damn same because I'm trying so hard to get to top 100 on a particular chart.
All the videos encase most of the data which games like ITG and osu! present to you at the end of your playthrough.
They encase the audio for my hits (the little slap noises);
they encase the audio for the song (which I assume is always the same);
they encase visual picture for hit confirmation;
The only thing I can't get from the videos is my timing difference from a Perfect or a Great, 
at least not with a bit more work on my part.
However, the game does the heavy lifting for me. There's a way to access a PFC playthrough that is automated for free.

# Possibilities
Given all of this stuff I've been harboring on my drive for purposes of me getting better at rhythmically mashing
my keyboard, I can turn it into something better to help me get even better.
I can retroactively look at my scores, see where I struggle (streams of eighth notes? swings? triplets?),
and become a better player through this new method.
